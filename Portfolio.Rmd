# 2011 Masters Golf Tournament Project

 The plot below is a line graph I created visualizing the summary of the Masters 2011 Pro Golf Tournament, along with the performance of each golfer and the overall winner of the comptetition (Charl Schwartzel).

# NFL 2023 QB Performance Project


### Overall QB Performance:

 I created a spreadsheet of all the NFL Quarterbacks that played a minimum of one game in the 2023-2024 season and compiled all of their advanced statistics. I then developed a formula in Excel aiming to grade their efficiency, MVP rating, and overall grade, and transferred the file into R to visualize my findings. The name displayed is my MVP according to my grading system and efficiency formula

```{r, fig.width=12, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
qbdata <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\ajcon\\Downloads\\Portfolio\\qbdata.xlsx")

mvp <- qbdata %>% 
  top_n(1, qbdata$Grade*qbdata$Efficiency)

ggplot(qbdata, aes(x = Efficiency, y = Grade, col = QB)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(data = mvp, aes(label = QB), nudge_x = -0.001, nudge_y = -0.05, segment.color = "black", segment.size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Weighted Efficiency Scale", y = "Grading Scale", title = "Overall QB Performance 2023 NFL Season") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```


### QB Performance by Team:

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=15}

  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = QB), nudge_x = 0, nudge_y = -0.05) +

# A Data-led Look into the History of the Olympics

 After gaining access to mulitple datasets of the Olympics containing every instance throughout every competition since the inaugural season back in 1896 (Greece) up until the 2016 Games in Brazil, I decided my free time would be well spent answering a couple of questions I, like many others (I think), have been wondering:

> 1. Does the economical stability of a country affect the number of athletes it sends to the olympics and the number of medals it wins?

> 2. Does hosting the olympics correlate to winning more medals that year?

### Part I

Below are the results I found for the first question, along with the code I wrote to filter and manipulate the data so I can visualize it in a more effective manner.

```{r, message=FALSE}
athlete_events <- read_csv(
   file = 'athlete_events.csv',
   col_types = cols(ID = 'i', Age = 'i', Height = 'i', Year = 'i')
)

nearest_year <- function(olympics_year) {
  gapminder_year <- seq(1952, 2007, by = 5)
  nearest_year <- gapminder_year[which.min(abs(olympics_year - gapminder_year))]
  return(nearest_year)
}

olympics_data <-
  athlete_events %>%
  filter(!is.na(Medal)) %>%
  count(Games, Event, NOC, Medal, Team, Year, Name) %>%
  mutate(year = nearest_year(Year))

country_money <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)


athletes_by_country_year <- olympics_data %>%
  group_by(Team, Year) %>%
  summarise(Total_Athletes = n_distinct(Name), .groups = 'drop')

medals_by_country_year <- olympics_data %>%
  group_by(Team, Year) %>%
  summarise(Total_Medals = n_distinct(Medal), .groups = 'drop')

joined_data_athletes <- inner_join(athletes_by_country_year, country_money, by = c("Year" = "year", "Team" = "country")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gdpPercap))

joined_data_medals <- inner_join(medals_by_country_year, country_money, by = c("Year" = "year", "Team" = "country")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gdpPercap))

ggplot(joined_data_athletes, aes(x = gdpPercap , y = Total_Athletes)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) + #Plotting the athlete correlation
  labs(title = "Number of Athletes vs Country's GDP Per Capita", x = "GDP Per Capita ($)", y = "Number of Athletes Country Sends")

ggplot(joined_data_medals, aes(x = gdpPercap , y = Total_Medals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = FALSE) + #lm creates a smooth line to show a clear representation
    labs(title = "Medals Won vs Country's GDP Per Capita", x = "GDP Per Capita ($)", y = "Medals Won")
```

> As we can see, there is in fact a positive correlation between a countryâ€™s gdp per capita and the number of medals and athletes a country has. This means that the higher the gdp is, the more medals it wins and more athletes it sends to the Olympics.


### Part II

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Importing relevant data sets
athlete_events  = read.csv("athlete_events.csv")
host_cities = read.csv("host_cities.csv")

# Renaming the 'city' variable in host_cities to 'City' so I can join the 2 datasets with key "City"
host_cities <- rename(host_cities, "City" = "city")

data <- full_join(athlete_events, host_cities, by = "City")
```

For the second question... I started by joining data sets together and creating a function that will filter the joint dataset for each country and in each of the seasons: determine whether they hosted or not. The function also displays a plot to compare the amount of medals that country won when they hosted vs when they did not. We will then compare and draw reasonable conclusions by creating a histogram containing the average number of medals all countries combined have won when they host vs in the competitions before.

```{r}
generate_country_medals_plot <- function(country_code, country_name, summer_hosts, winter_hosts) {
 
  # SUMMER
  summer_plot <- NULL
 
  if (length(summer_hosts) > 0) {
    summer_medals <- data %>%
      filter(NOC == country_code & !is.na(Medal) & Season == "Summer" & Year %in% c(1896:2016)) %>%
      distinct(Year, Event) %>%
      group_by(Year) %>%
      summarise(Medal_Count = n())
   
    summer_medals$Host <- ifelse(summer_medals$Year %in% summer_hosts, "Hosted", "Not Hosted")
   
    summer_plot <- ggplot(summer_medals, aes(x = Year, y = Medal_Count, fill = Host)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
      geom_text(aes(label = Year), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
      labs(x = "Year", y = "Medals", title = paste("Summer Olympic Medals won by", country_name))
  }
 
  # WINTER
  winter_plot <- NULL
 
  if (length(winter_hosts) > 0) {
    winter_medals <- data %>%
      filter(NOC == country_code & !is.na(Medal) & Season == "Winter" & Year %in% c(1896:2016)) %>%
      distinct(Year, Event) %>%
      group_by(Year) %>%
      summarise(Medal_Count = n())
   
    winter_medals$Host <- ifelse(winter_medals$Year %in% winter_hosts, "Hosted", "Not Hosted")
   
    winter_plot <- ggplot(winter_medals, aes(x = Year, y = Medal_Count, fill = Host)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
      geom_text(aes(label = Year), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
      labs(x = "Year", y = "Medals", title = paste("Winter Olympic Medals won by", country_name))
  }
 
  list(summer_plot = summer_plot, winter_plot = winter_plot)
}

As stated earlier, I created a histogram of the difference of medals **(by subtracting the medals won when they host minus the medals won in the olympic season directly prior)** to draw a reasonable conclusion.

```{r}
hist_data <- tibble(
  NOC = c("USA", "AUS", "AUT", "BEL", "BRA", "CAN", "CHN", "FIN", "FRA", "GER", "GRE", "ITA", "JPN", "MEX", "NED", "NOR", "RUS", "KOR", "ESP", "SWE", "SUI", "GBR", "YUG"),
  Medals_Won_Host = c(451, 83, 13, 33, 18, 39, 85, 22, 109, 102, 45, 47, 36, 9, 22, 29, 130, 30, 22, 64, 9, 165, 1),
  Medals_Won_Year_Before = c(265, 49, 8, 5, 17, 29, 55, 19, 52, 39, 16, 33, 22, 1, 11, 18, 84, 18, 4, 53, 5, 76, 3))

new <- hist_data %>%
  mutate(Distribution_difference = Medals_Won_Host - Medals_Won_Year_Before)

hist(new$Distribution_difference, xlab = "Difference between Medals (Host Season - Season Before)", main = "Histogram of the Distribution Difference", col = "lightgreen")
```

> We can see there is a positive host effect country on the amount of medals won when a country hosts the olympics vs when they don't because there is an overall positive difference.
