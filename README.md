This project portfolio covers a diverse range of data analytics topics, each focusing on a different event or domain. Here's a summary of each project:

(The Rmd contains the projoct code, the html and pdf are the outputs.)

### 1. 2011 Masters Golf Tournament Project
- Objective: Analyze the performance of golfers in the 2011 Masters Golf Tournament.
- Approach: Visualized the summary of the tournament, individual golfer performance, and identified the overall winner (Charl Schwartzel) using R.
- Techniques: Data manipulation, visualization using ggplot2, and statistical analysis.
  
### 2. NFL 2023 QB Performance Project
- Objective: Evaluate the performance of NFL quarterbacks during the 2023-2024 season.
- Approach: Compiled advanced statistics of quarterbacks, developed a grading system, and identified the MVP.
- Techniques: Data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization using ggplot2.
  
### 3. A Data-led Look into the History of the Olympics
- Objective: Investigate the relationship between a country's economic stability, Olympic performance, and the impact of hosting the Olympics.
- Approach: Analyzed datasets spanning the history of the Olympics, filtering and visualizing data to draw insights.
- Techniques: Data manipulation, correlation analysis, and visualization using ggplot2.

### 4. XLK Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression
Objective: Predict the future stock prices of XLK using machine learning techniques.
Approach: Gathered historical stock data, split it into training and testing sets, trained a linear regression model, and evaluated its performance.
Techniques: Data preprocessing, model training with linear regression, evaluation using Root Mean Square Error, and visualization using ggplot2.
  
### 5. Future Projects
- Next Steps: Planning to analyze the passing networks of the 2003-2004 Arsenal FC soccer team using Graph Theory concepts and techniques.
- Approach: Likely to involve network analysis and graph theory.
