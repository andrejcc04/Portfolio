### 2. USA House Market - Price Prediction with Linear Regression
- Objective: Predict house prices in the USA based on various features such as number of beds, baths, and living space.
- Approach: Loaded and cleaned the housing data, handled missing values and outliers, split the data into training and testing sets, trained a linear regression model on the training data, evaluated the model on the testing data, visualized the results, and created an interface for user input to predict house prices.
- Techniques: Data science, data manipulation, outlier detection, linear regression modeling, evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualization using ggplot2.

### 3. Formula 1 Project - Predicting Race Winner with Classification Modeling
- Objective: Predict the winner of F1 races using various machine learning models.
- Approach: Joined relevant datasets, engineered features, split features, trained different models (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine) to classify and predict race winners on  different tracks, combined the models to create a final and precise Ensemble Method Model. Evauluated model performance using a variety of metrics, visualized metrics, created an interface to predict winner of a race based on track and year input.
- Techniques: Data science, data manipulation, feature engineering, classification using SVM, RF, and GBM models, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning, model evaluation using confusion matrix, and visualization using ggplot2.

### 4. Formula 1 Project - Predicting Driver Laptimes
- Objective: Predict lap times for the every Grand Prix in the 2024 season based on historical data.
- Approach: Loaded and merged multiple F1 race-related datasets, converted lap times to a readable format, filtered and cleaned the data for the Bahrain Grand Prix, removed outliers, split the data into training and testing sets, trained a linear regression model, evaluated the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), visualized predicted vs actual lap times, and created a user interface for user input on driver, track, and lap.
- Techniques: Data science, data manipulation, outlier detection, feature engineering, linear regression modeling, evaluation using RMSE, and visualization using ggplot2.
